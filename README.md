# MainMallHustle
A Cardboard VR viewer experience that drops you right into the middle of life on campus. Experience UBC even before coming to Vancouver!

# About the Project
Picture this: Your class starts in 10 minutes and you haven’t had coffee. You come out of the Nest Building, your favorite hangout spot on UBC’s Vancouver campus. Take a look around and what do you see? Most days – a sea of people. Your goal right now is to get from one side of UBC’s crowded “Main Mall” to the other in time for your next class. Easier said than done. For one thing, there’s the constant construction. It’s like a permanent obstacle course out there! Then there are all those pesky squirrels. And of course, there are thousands of other students trying to get from one building to the next and they haven’t had coffee either. The timer starts, and you set off. Good luck doing the Main Mall Hustle. Remember: don’t be late for class!

# Who is this app for?
